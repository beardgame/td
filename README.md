## The game

### Systemic

TD offers an abstract level of simulation of various systems. By cleverly using the features each of the six elements offer, players are able to use the interactions to their benefit... or their detriment if they are not careful.

### Procedurally generated

No game in TD is the same, as both the map and the enemy waves are fully procedurally generated.

### Multiplayer friendly

TD was built with multiplayer front of mind. The game can be played in co-op mode with multiple players controlling the same faction. Other game modes are planned for the future to allow for a wide variety of gameplay experiences when playing together with your friends.

### Moddable

The content for TD is defined in an extensible way, allowing you to design new combinations of behaviours for towers, enemies, or even entire game modes. Just create your own mod folder and start modding.

### Built in custom engine

The game is built on top of a custom game engine, using OpenTK for basic windowing and OpenGL/OpenAL bindings. Much of the common code can be found in the MIT licensed open source libraries under the [beardgame](https://github.com/beardgame) organisation on GitHub.

## Development

The game is still under heavy development, and features should not be considered final or representative of the final game. A new release is published roughly each month, and the latest version can be downloaded from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/beardgame/td/releases) page. Feel free to open issues with any feedback.
